# C# Fundamentals — Course Guide

## What is this course?

**C# Fundamentals** teaches Microsoft’s **C#** language from the ground up: variables, `switch`, loops, methods, classes, and collections. Theory is step-by-step; challenges check your code with **pattern tests** (C# runs in a light browser simulator for simple programs).

**Live URL:** `/learn/c-sharp-fundamentals`

**Who it’s for:** Beginners who want C# for games (Unity), apps, or backend .NET work.

## Quick tips for editors

1. Challenges should use patterns tests understand (`Console.WriteLine`, `int`, `class`, etc.)  
2. Full .NET features are **not** in the browser runner — keep challenges beginner-level  
3. Edit **`data/csharpCurriculum.js`** for content
