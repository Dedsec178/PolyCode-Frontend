# Pandas · py — Course Guide

## What is this course?

**Pandas · py** teaches **Pandas** — Python’s library for tables of data (like Excel sheets in code). Topics include Series, DataFrames, filtering, cleaning, grouping, and merging CSV-style data. Each lesson has theory, then a hands-on **Python challenge**.

**Live URL:** `/learn/pandas-py`

**Who it’s for:** Learners who finished or are doing NumPy and want to analyze real-world tables and datasets.

## Quick tips for editors

1. Edit lesson content in **`data/pandasCurriculum.js`**  
2. Add videos in **`data/pandasVideoLinks.js`**  
3. Lesson ids look like `pandas-0`, `pandas-1`, etc. — keep ids stable when adding links
