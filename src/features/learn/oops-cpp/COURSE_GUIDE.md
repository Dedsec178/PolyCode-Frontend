# OOPs C++ — Course Guide

## What is this course?

**OOPs C++** teaches **object-oriented programming in C++**: classes, objects, constructors, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and design ideas used in real software. Lessons use rich theory cards and **real C++ compile-and-run** challenges. Progress can sync to the **backend** when the user is signed in.

**Live URL:** `/learn/oops-cpp`

**Who it’s for:** Learners who know C++ basics (ideally **C++ Fundamentals**) and want to build with classes and OOP.

## Shared code

- **shared/** — certificates, read gate, runCpp, lesson shell  
- Backend route: progress tied to authenticated user

## Quick tips for editors

1. Theory block types include `table`, `stepthrough`, `diagram` — see existing lessons in **oopsCurriculum.js**  
2. Challenges must compile as real C++ — test on backend with `g++` when possible  
3. **Pointers C++** reuses **ConceptCard**, **CodeChallenge**, and **OopsSidebar** from this folder
